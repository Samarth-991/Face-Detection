# Face-Detection
Face detection and recognition includes C++ and Python based code for solving basic face detection and face recognition problem.
The code uses the data stream from cctv/rstp cameras directly to process the images to detect faces in the live stream and recognize from a database of one hundered and fifty labelled faces .
The code uses a CNN based face detector from dlib and enhances the accuracy by using image pyramid techniques scale the image to detect faces from very high to low resolutions.

Please look at demo videos for visualization .

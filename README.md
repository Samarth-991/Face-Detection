# Face-Detection
Face detection and recognition includes C++ and Python based code for solving basic face detection and face recognition problem.
The algorithm accepts stream of data from cctv/rstp cameras directly to process the images to detect faces in the live stream and recognize from a database of one hundered and fifty labelled faces.

CNN based face detector from dlib and enhances the accuracy by using image pyramid techniques to scale the image to detect faces from very high to low resolutions and also capable of extracting Occuled faces from object or person.
